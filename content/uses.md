The idea of a Uses page is to tell you about the stuff I use.

Make sure to check out [uses.tech](https://uses.tech/) for a list of everyone's Uses pages!

I often get asked about what software or hardware I use, so this page will serve as a living document and a place to point curious readers to when I get asked.

## Editor + Terminal

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is my current editor for work.
- [Pycharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) is what I use for personal projects
- Chrome is my main browser
- iTerm2 is my terminal on Mac, gitBash on Windows.
- I used to be a sweaty CLI-user, but lately have been really enjoying [Github Desktop UI](https://desktop.github.com/)


## Python Tools

- [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) for pretty much all of my API/app backend prototyping
- [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) for quick and easy UI setup
- [Hugo](https://docs.hugoblox.com/) for blogging
- [Alembic](https://github.com/sqlalchemy/alembic) for DB versioning
- Would love to use [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) more, but it's caused some issues on some personal projects, so I need to circle back next time I format my computer.


## Other Apps

- [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) for project management and just keeping organized in general.
- [Hashicorp Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/) for Secrets Management. Really powerful x-platform tool with great integrations.
- I'm partial to AWS as a cloud provider, but have some experience with GCP as well. Sorry Azure. I really want to try out Databricks again, haven't used it since it was a glorified notebook hosting service.
